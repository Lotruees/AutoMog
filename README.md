# AutoMog

Automated Audio Mog program, with the help of UAssetAPI this program automates the process of using AudioMog to replace or make custom sound files for Kingdom Hearts 3

- Simply drag and drop a .wav file/folder containing .wav files onto the .exe and follow the process on the screen,
- Make sure your .wav file/folder that contains .wav files is in the same path as the AutoMog.exe,
- When dropping a singular file it'll prompt you for a path you'll want the file to be referenced in game,
- When dropping folders the program will automatically set the folder structure as the path to be referenced in game,
- The duration property will be automatically set using the current .wav file's duration.

**This program heavily depends on AudioMog** which I have not included in the .zip, it can be downloaded from here, https://github.com/Yoraiz0r/AudioMog, the contents of Release.zip must be extracted to the Templates folder, **make sure the AudioMog.exe is in the Templates folder before running the program**.
Lastly, this program was built with the help of **UAssetAPI**, it can be downloaded here if interested in making any programs that mess with .uasset files, https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetAPI
